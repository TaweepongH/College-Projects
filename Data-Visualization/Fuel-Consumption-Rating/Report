OVERVIEW
The Government of Canada provide essential information about the fuel consumption rating in light duty vehicles. The data is collected by Environment and Climate Change Canada from the vehicles manufactures. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) then published the Fuel Consumption Rating to help consumers compare vehicles and choose the most fuel-efficient option that meets their daily needs. We obtained a database from Natural Resources Canada's Open Government Licence - Canada  providing a comparison of various manufacturers and vehicle types based on fuel economy and CO2 emissions from 2012 to 2023.

PROBLEMS
In Canada, 27 percent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from the transportation sector. Nearly half of this is from light-duty vehicles - the cars, vans and light trucks we drive. Although car manufacturers have managed to reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants (CACs) from cars and light trucks, fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have steadily increased over the past two decades. That is because CO2 is an unavoidable by-product of burning fossil fuels. CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas linked to climate change. Although light-duty vehicles are more fuel efficient than they were in the 1970s, there are many more vehicles on the road today, and we're driving them farther than before, using more fuel. While much of the energy used in Canada is necessary, there are times when we could use energy more wisely (Government of Canada, 2010).
In light of these facts, people must make conscientious decisions about which vehicle should be more convenient both in terms of fuel economy as well as environmental friendliness. In this context, it is essential to address the following questions in our analysis:

QUESTIONS
•	What types of vehicles are there in Canada and how do they relate to fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?
•	What is the relationship between driving mode (city/highway) and CO2 emissions?
•	What is the relationship between engine type and combined (city/highway) fuel consumption per 100km?
•	What are the changes that have occurred in the levels of CO2 emissions, and what do we anticipate for the upcoming years?
•	What is the current trajectory of fuel consumption, and what are the projected alternatives that are expected to emerge in the near future?
•	How can the reputation of a vehicle be understood in terms of the CO2 emissions it produces?
•	What is the most fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicle segment in terms of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption?

METHODOLOGY
We obtained a database from Natural Resources Canada's Open Government Licence - Canada  providing a comparison of various manufacturers and vehicle types based on fuel economy and CO2 emissions. To guarantee accuracy and consistency, we took considerable care to clean and integrate these datasets using Python. We were able to acquire trustworthy data using this rigorous process, which served as the foundation for our following data visualization analysis.

GOAL
What are the vehicles with superior fuel efficiency and commendable CO2 emission rating within the period of 2012 to 2023 in Canada?

DATASET
Datasets provide information on model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty cars available for purchase in Canada. Fuel consumption figures for vehicles made between 2012 and 2023 have been changed to reflect more realistic testing procedures that better match normal driving situations, allowing for easier comparisons between model years. It is crucial to note that these are merely estimates based on the original ratings, not actual vehicle testing (Open Data Canada, 2023)
The data set contains information about fuel consumption rating in vehicles such as electric, hybrid and gasoline information. The objective of this data set is to explore how three different vehicles segments are being rating according to CO2 emissions.
