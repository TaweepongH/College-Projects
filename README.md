# College-Projects
In this GitHub repository, you will find a collection of projects completed by me during my time at college. These projects cover a range of topics such as data analysis, visualization, and web development. Each project has its own folder with relevant code and documentation, making it easy for anyone to understand and reproduce the work. Whether you are interested in exploring data, creating beautiful visualizations, or building web applications, this repository has something for you.
